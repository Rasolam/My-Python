## Lists
## Syntax - [] square brakets


## Example

my_list = ["warhammer","40k","old world"]


print(my_list)

# Check a lists length
# Shows 3 items in the list

my_list2 = ["warhammer","40k","old world"]

print(len(my_list2))

## To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.
# The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
# 
# Example
# The below code will insert watermelon where cherry is becoming num 2 in index. cherry then becomes index 3

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(thislist)


##  Changing values ina list.
# To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:

# The below example refers to variable thislist and index 1 which is bannana
# we then = blackcurrent replacing bannana
# Example

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)


## To change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values, 
# and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:
# example

thislist2 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
thislist2[1:3] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist2)


####--REMEMBER--####
# If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:
# example

thislist3 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist3[1:2] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist3)

## APPEND ITEMS
#  To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:
# The below code will use append to add orange at the end of the list
# Example
 

my_list = ["warhammer","40k","old world"]
my_list.append("orange")

print(my_list)


## INSERT
# To insert a list item at a specified index, use the insert() method.
# The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
# Example

my_list2 = ["warhammer","40k","old world"]
my_list2.insert(2,"heroquest")

print(my_list2)


## EXTEND
# To append elements from another list to the current list, use the extend() method.
# extend allows you to add another variable containing alist and adds it on to first list
# The extend() method does not have to append lists, you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.)
# Example

my_list3 =["warhammer","40k","old world"]
best_game =["lotr","mesbg","ww2"]
my_list3.extend(best_game)
print(my_list3)

## accessing list items

## accessing lists are done by reffering to index number
# lists are indexed starting from 0 (zero)
# Displays 40k as this is number 1 in the list. Warhammer is 0 and old world is 2
# Example

my_list = ["warhammer","40k","old world"]

print(my_list[1])

### Negative indexing
# Negative indexing is the same as normal except it starts from the end and works back
# Think of it as an excel right function
# Example

my_list2 = ["warhammer","40k","old world"]

print(my_list2[-1])

## Range Indexing
# You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
# When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items
# in the below example the range starts at old world ends at risk but only displays
# old world and heorquest.
#Example

my_list3 = ["warhammer","40k","old world","heroquest","risk","monopoly"]

print(my_list3[2:4])


# By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:
# example
# print(my_list3[:4])

# By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:
# print(my_list3[2:])
